      than 500 ml per day. Do note that milk is still an important source of calcium and complete protein for
       vegetarians. Not just milk, dairy products like curd, paneer (Fresh cheese) and cheese also
        count towards this quota.<br><br>

        Iron is an important nutrient for babies and kids. It may not be as easily available in a vegetarian diet.

         source of protein and iron in a vegetarian diet. You can refer to the 31 iron rich foods for babies and
